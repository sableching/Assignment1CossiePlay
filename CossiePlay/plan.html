<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>To attract more people to order costumes and come to their monthly parties.</p>


<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>

<p>Success can be evaluated by calculating the increase in revenue earned by the company through the number of costumes
made and the entrance fees for the parties.</p>


<h2>Target Audience</h2>

<p>They want to attract more teenagers and young adults. To do this, I will design the website to be more brightly-coloured and with at least 1 image on each page so that it would be less dull for the users to look at. This is because teenagers tend to respond better to brighter colours as compared to a black and white website.</p>
